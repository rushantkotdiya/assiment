#### Q1. Are the HTML tags and elements the same thing?


1. **HTML Tags**: Tags are enclosed within angle brackets (< and >) and typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. For example, `<p>` is an opening tag for a paragraph, and `</p>` is a closing tag for the same paragraph.

2. **HTML Elements**: HTML element is made up of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. The content is the information. For example, `<p>This is a paragraph.</p>` is an HTML element where `<p>` is the opening tag, `This is a paragraph.` is the content, and `</p>` is the closing tag.


#### Q2. What are tags and attributes in HTML?


1. **HTML Tags**: Tags are enclosed within angle brackets (< and >) and typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. For example, `<p>` is an opening tag for a paragraph, and `</p>` is a closing tag for the same paragraph.

2. **HTML Attributes**: Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are placed within the opening tag of an element and consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (`=`). Attributes modify the behavior or appearance of an element. For instance, the `href` attribute in an `<a>` tag specifies the URL that the link should point to, and the `src` attribute in an `<img>` tag specifies the source of the image to be displayed. Attributes can be optional or required depending on the element they are associated with.

 example of an HTML element (`<a>` tag) with attributes:

```html
<a href="https://example.com" title="Visit Example Website">Example</a>
```

#### Q3. What are void elements in HTML? With Example.

Void elements, also known as self-closing  elements. Instead, they are self-contained and typically do not require a separate closing tag. Void elements are used to insert specific types of content, such as images or line breaks, into an HTML document.

 examples of void elements in HTML:

1. `<img>`: Used to embed images in a web page.
2. `<br>`: Used to insert line breaks within text.
3. `<input>`: Used to create input fields in forms.
4. `<link>`: Used to link external resources like stylesheets.
5. `<meta>`: Used to provide metadata about the HTML document.

#### Q4. What are HTML entities? With example.
HTML entities are written as sequences that start with an ampersand (`&`) and end with a semicolon (`;`). They can represent characters from the ASCII character set or characters from other character sets like Unicode.

 a few common HTML entities:

1. `&lt;`: Represents the less-than sign `<`.
2. `&gt;`: Represents the greater-than sign `>`.
3. `&amp;`: Represents the ampersand `&`.
4. `&quot;`: Represents the double quotation mark `"`.
5. `&apos;`: Represents the apostrophe (single quotation mark) `'`.
6. `&nbsp;`: Represents a non-breaking space.

Here's an example of how HTML entities are used in HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>HTML Entities Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>HTML Entities Example</h1>
    <p>In HTML, you use &lt;p&gt; tags to define paragraphs.</p>
    <p>
      Some special characters include &amp;, &lt;, &gt;, &quot;, and &apos;.
    </p>
  </body>

#### Q5. What are different types of lists in HTML? With Example

 The main types of lists in HTML are:

1. **Ordered List (`<ol>`)**:  ordered list is a list where each item is marked with a number or another sequential marker. By default, the marker is a number. Each list item is enclosed within `<li>` (list item) tags. Here's an example:

```html
<ol>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ol>
```

2. **Unordered List (`<ul>`)**: An unordered list is a list where each item is marked with a bullet point or another non-sequential marker. Each list item is enclosed within `<li>` (list item) tags. Here's an example:

```html
<ul>
  <li>Red</li>
  <li>Green</li>
  <li>Blue</li>
</ul>
```

3. **Description List (`<dl>`)**: A description list is a list of term-description pairs. Each term (`<dt>` - description term) is followed by its corresponding description (`<dd>` - description details). Here's an example:

```html
<dl>
  <dt>HTML</dt>
  <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>
  <dt>CSS</dt>
  <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>
  <dt>JavaScript</dt>
  <dd>A programming language</dd>
</dl>
```

</html>
```

<HR>

#### Q7. What is the difference between the ‘id’ attribute and the ‘class’ attribute of HTML elements? With Example.



1. **`id` Attribute**:

   - The `id` attribute is used to uniquely identify a single element on a web page. Each `id` value must be unique within the entire HTML document.
   - The `id` attribute is often used for elements that are unique or represent a key component within a page.
   - When you use the `id` attribute, you precede the value with a hash (`#`).

2. **`class` Attribute**:
   .In HTML, the `class` attribute is used to assign one or more class names to an HTML element. you can style multiple elements at once without having to target them individually.
- When you use the `class` attribute, you precede the value with a hash (`.`). 

 example of the `id` and `class` attributes:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Id vs Class Example</title>
    <style>
      /* CSS targeting id */
      #unique {
        color: blue;
      }

      /* CSS targeting class */
      .highlight {
        background-color: yellow;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="unique">This is a uniquely identified element.</div>

#### Q8. What are the various formatting tags in HTML?

.
1. **Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`)**: Used to define headings of different levels, with `<h1>` being the most important and `<h6>` being the least important.

2. **Paragraph (`<p>`)**: Used to define paragraphs of text.

3. **Bold (`<b>`) and Strong (`<strong>`)**: Both are used to indicate strong importance. `<strong>` is semantically preferred over `<b>` as it carries more weight in terms of significance.

4. **Italic (`<i>`) and Emphasis (`<em>`)**: Both are used to indicate emphasis, such as highlighting a word or phrase. `<em>` is semantically preferred over `<i>`.

5. **Underline (`<u>`)**: Used to underline text. However, it's generally recommended to use CSS for text decoration instead of the `<u>` tag.



10. **Code (`<code>`)**: Used to indicate inline code snippets .

#### Q9. How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing? With Example.

Cell padding and cell spacing are both attributes used in HTML tables to control the spacing and padding around the content within table cells, but they serve different purposes:

1. **Cell Padding**:
  
   - It is specified using the `cellpadding` attribute within the `<table>` tag.
   - The value of `cellpadding` determines the amount of space (in pixels or other units) between the content and the cell border.
2. **Cell Spacing**:
   - It is specified using the `cellspacing` attribute within the `<table>` tag.
   - The value of `cellspacing` determines the amount of space (in pixels or other units) between adjacent cells.
   - Cell spacing affects the space between all adjacent cells in the table.

 example of cell padding and cell spacing:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

1. **rowspan**: This attribute specifies the number of rows a cell should span.
2. **colspan**: This attribute specifies the number of columns a cell should span.

 example of how to use `rowspan` and `colspan` attributes to merge cells in an HTML table:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

#### Q11. What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?

Block-level elements and inline elements are two types of HTML elements that behave differently in terms of their layout and interaction with other elements on a web page:

1. **Block-Level Elements**:

   - Block-level elements typically start on a new line and occupy the full width available to them.
   - They create "blocks" of content, such as paragraphs, headings, divs, and sections.
  
   - Examples of block-level elements include `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>` to `<h6>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>`.

2. **Inline Elements**:
   - Inline elements do not start on a new line and only occupy the width necessary for their content.
   - They flow within the surrounding text or content, allowing other elements to sit beside them on the same line.
   
   - Examples of inline elements include `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<img>`, `<input>`, and `<br>`.

create a hyperlink in HTML:

```html
<a href="URL">Link Text</a>
```

- The `href` attribute specifies the destination of the hyperlink. It can be a URL, a file path, an email address , or an anchor within the same page .
- The link text is the visible text that users click on to navigate to the destination specified in the `href` attribute.

 example of creating a hyperlink :

```html

#### Q16. How are active links different from normal links?



1. **Normal Links**:

   - Normal links  are the standard hyperlinks displayed on a webpage.
  
   - When a user clicks on a normal link, the browser navigates to the specified destination URL or performs the associated action, such as opening a new page or downloading a file.

2. **Active Links**:
   - Active links refer to links that are currently being interacted with by the user.
   - They represent the state of a link when it is being clicked or interacted with, but the action has not yet been completed.
  
   - Active links may have different visual styles compared to normal links, such as a change in color or background to indicate that they are currently being interacted with.

#### Q18. What is SVG?

SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is an XML-based vector image format used for describing two-dimensional graphics, such as icons, illustrations, charts, and diagrams, for the web and other digital platforms. Unlike raster image formats (e.g., JPEG, PNG, GIF), which are composed of pixels, SVG images are composed of scalable shapes and paths defined by mathematical equations.

SVG images have several advantages:



SVG images can be embedded directly into HTML documents using the `<svg>` element or referenced externally using the `<img>` element or CSS background properties. They are widely supported by modern web browsers and have become a popular choice for creating vector graphics on the web.

#### Q19. What is difference between HTML and XHTML?

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible Hypertext Markup Language) are both markup languages used to structure and present content on the web. While they share many similarities, there are some key differences between them:


In summary, XHTML is a stricter and more consistent version of HTML that follows the rules of XML. It enforces well-formedness and is more suitable for interoperability with XML-based technologies. However, HTML is more forgiving and easier to write for beginners. The choice between HTML and XHTML depends on factors such as the project requirements, compatibility considerations, and personal preference.

#### Q20. What are logical and physical tags in HTML?



1. **Physical Tags**:

   - Physical tags are also known as "presentational" or "traditional" tags.
   - They are based on the visual appearance of the content rather than its meaning or structure.
   - Examples of physical tags include `<b>` for bold, `<i>` for italic, `<font>` for font size and color, `<u>` for underline, etc.
   - Physical tags are primarily used for styling and formatting content, but they don't provide any semantic meaning to the content.

2. **Logical Tags**:
   - Logical tags are based on the semantic meaning or structure of the content.
   - They describe the purpose or role of the content, making it more meaningful and accessible to both humans and machines.
   - Examples of logical tags include `<h1>` to `<h6>` for headings, `<p>` for paragraphs, `<ul>` and `<ol>` for lists, `<table>` for tables, etc.
   - Logical tags are preferred in modern web development because they improve accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and maintainability of the code.


Logical tags (preferred):

```html
<p>
  This is a <strong>strong</strong> example of using logical tags for emphasis.
</p>
<p>This is an <em>emphasized</em> example.</p>
```

Physical tags (less preferred):

```html
<p>This is a <b>strong</b> example of using physical tags for emphasis.</p>
<p>This is an <i>italicized</i> example.</p>
```
